      "I created my portfolio website using a combination of modern web technologies to showcase my skills and projects. I started by designing the layout, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built the structure and added interactive elements for a smooth user experience. To enhance the design, I incorporated CSS frameworks like Bootstrap/Tailwind for responsiveness. For better functionality, I used JavaScript to add dynamic content, and if applicable, I implemented React for a more modular and scalable approach. I also integrated animations and effects to make the website visually appealing. Finally, I deployed the site using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, making it accessible online. Throughout the process, I focused on optimizing performance, ensuring mobile responsiveness, and maintaining a professional aesthetic.",
